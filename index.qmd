# Overview
This mini-workshop is intended to introduce you to R's object systems. There are actually a lot of them, but we are going to focus on the two or three most important ones. My goal is to answer some very basic questions, like:

 - What is an object system and why does R need one?
 - Why does R have so many object systems?
 - How do I know what object system is relevant for my work?
 - How do I interact with the most common object systems?

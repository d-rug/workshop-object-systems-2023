# Introduction
As a statistician and data scientist, the objects I interact with most often in R are data frames and regression models. Actually R's numbers and vectors are "objects" of a sort, but not in the sense that they need an object system. You can see the difference here:

```{r is.object}
# you can check whether something is an object with is.object()
is.object( c("a", "b", "c") )
is.object( 13 )
is.object( data.frame() )

# to be an object means to have a class:
attr( c("a", "b", "c"), "class")
attr( 13, "class")
attr( data.frame(), "class")
```

**Objects** are the nouns of a computer language. They provide two main functions: *encapsulation* and *polymorphism*. 

 - *Encapsulation*: many different parts can be bundled together into a single object.
 - *Polymorphism*: you can do many different things using functions that share the same name (e.g., `plot()`).
